    <p>Hi and welcome back to our week two lessons. <br> You may remember from <em>earlier</em> that we created a template like the one we're looking at here to use as a basis for our future HTML files. So I've taken this template, and I've saved it as html2.html and made a few changes, calling it My Second Page and experimenting with <strong>Links and Text.</strong></p>
